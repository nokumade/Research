The Implied volatility directional forecasting project focuses on predicting the volatility of the market via an index.
The project implemented many classification models which tried to predict the direction of the volatility.
After hypertuning all the models, they were assessed on several criterias, such as AUC, MCE, F-Score, Kappa.
Additonally, the frequency table of all lagged values of the time-series variables was constructed, to gain a close
inspection on the importance of all variables in the prediction process.
