    The Bristil Stock Exchange project is about the implementation of several trading bots and market simulation with
the aim to get the highest profit. The BSE works as a Limit-Order-Book, however, unlike the usual financial market,
in BSE the price at the consecutive period is not the historical price, but is the result of actions and interactions
of the traders active at the current time period, thus users of BSE are able to replicate and model market impact.
Additionally, in BSE there is only one tradable security, which all the agents buy and sell.
    One of the best of these robots was the Sniper (SNPR). It's strategy was staying low, until the time is about to 
run out or the gap between best and worst price is low and steal the show.
